# Rasprotect-System
Raspberry pi + IR Sensor + Camera + GUI Interface

This program incorporates a Raspberry Pi with SenseHat, an IR Sensor, and a camera. 

When the IR sensor is triggered, this takes a picture of the 'intruder', and sends a tweet and email to the administrator. 

The pictures are visible online via the Flask server program.
